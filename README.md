# Simple-Server-Auto-Config
This is just some small codes I wrote to automate my server's configurations during high school.

Packages that have to be installed and will be used in the auto configuration:
- Debian 9 (OS)
- Bind9 (DNS)
- Apache2 (Webserver)
- Postfix (Mail server)

I managed to always get good scores because I always succeed in setting up the server during my high school years.
